INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXECUTING THE SCRIPT IN A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK ENVIRONMENT:

1. Open your Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook).

2. Create a new Python notebook or open an existing one.

3. Copy and paste the entire code provided in your project file into a new cell in the notebook.

4. Ensure that the dataset 'incident_event_log.csv' is available in the same directory as your notebook or adjust the file path in the code accordingly.

5. Before running the code, install any required packages that are not already present in your environment. You can install packages using the command:
   !pip install [package_name]

   For example, to install the 'imbalanced-learn' package used in the project, run:
   !pip install -U imbalanced-learn

6. Execute the entire notebook by selecting 'Run All' from the 'Cell' menu, or run each cell individually by selecting it and pressing 'Shift + Enter'.

7. The notebook will display outputs, including any visualizations, after each code block. Ensure you run the cells in the order they are provided to maintain the logical flow and dependencies of the code.

8. If you encounter any errors, check for common issues such as:
   - Missing packages or incorrect package versions.
   - File path errors if the dataset is not in the correct location.
   - Syntax errors or typos in the code.

9. After successful execution, you can save the notebook with outputs for reference or export it as a PDF or HTML file if required.
